- 👋 Hi, I’m Rasul.
- 🌱 I am studying to become a web developer.
- ⚡️Interesting fact: “Deleting the System32 file will not break your computer, but on the contrary, it will speed up and optimize your computer.”
- 🔭Why is my work on a cool project like a telescope? 🔭 Because I look at the monitor and see... an endless stream of errors! And it seems the universe is hinting that I should read the documentation more often! 🌱 Ask me about GitHub - I'll tell you how I tried to make a "simple fix" and ended up breaking half the project, just like only experienced programmers can do! 💬.
